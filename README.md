# Bug Reports

Python script developed to chart bug creation and resolution over time from Jira data and proivide better visual insight into the health of our system deployment and development to organization stakeholders. 

Charts include color-coding by category, severity, or resolution status depending on the chart viewed. Charts are done primarly in Seaborn and exported in both HTML and PNG formats for use in presentations to stakeholders.  

Multi-file support added due to limitation of 100 lines for export from Jira for supported customers.
